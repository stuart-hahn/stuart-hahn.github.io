Recently I installed Arch Linux (btw) and have started diving into the excruciatingly fun world of .config files. Oh boy.

It's been going pretty well, but it's a slow process, and since I'm using two machines (I have a PC and a laptop) I've been trying to sync up my settings.

Soon I'll make some dotfiles and put them in a repo so I can configure any machine quickly, but for now I'm just going through the process twice.

Anyway, part of the process involves setting up NeoVim, my code editor of choice.

"Why don't you just use VSCode?" I can hear you think.

Well, I like VSCode but I don't like how it spies on you, and I don't trust that it isn't at some point going to be a paid service or start with some other shady practices that I can't get behind.

The open-sourceness of Linux and VSCode appeals to me. As does the painstaking setup and configuration process that I've been slogging through for the last couple of weeks.

It's fun, I promise.

NeoVim is cool because it starts very bare-bones but you can supercharge it however you'd like. Many people have turned it into a fully blown IDE as powerful (if not MORE powerful) than the great VSCode itself.

I started by trying to make my own `.config/nvim` but realized that creating all my own keybindings from scratch probably isn't the best idea. Yes, it would work for me, but it would also make it harder to get comfortable using any other computer that didn't have such gloriously finely-tuned keymaps ready to go.

So I started looking into "NeoVim Distros", and they hit the spot. There are a few options, but I went with LazyVim because it is modern, highly-customizable, easy-to-learn, and works great right out of the box.
