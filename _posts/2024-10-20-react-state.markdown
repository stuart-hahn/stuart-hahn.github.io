I’ve been building small React apps with TypeScript, refreshing my React skills while learning TypeScript at the same time.

Sometimes, I wonder if I’m making things harder than they need to be. Wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on _just_ React or _just_ TypeScript instead of tackling both simultaneously?

## Should You Focus on One Thing at a Time?

At first glance, focusing on a single skill seems more efficient—especially when you consider that multitasking is largely a myth and single-tasking is proven to be more productive.

It makes sense to think that should apply to learning, too, right?

But it doesn't.

I used to believe that diving deep into one topic before moving on to the next would help me learn faster and retain more. In programming terms, this would mean mastering React first, then TypeScript (or the other way around).

But according to the science of effective learning, that's not the best approach.

## Interleaving: A Better Way to Learn

There’s a learning technique called _interleaving_ that’s a bit counterintuitive. It involves learning multiple, related concepts at the same time.

When you try it, it feels wrong. It's harder—your brain has to switch gears constantly, and you lose the comfort of drilling the same thing over and over.

But that struggle is actually a sign of deeper learning. It means your brain is working harder, which primes you to be more flexible when things get complicated in the future.

### A Lesson from Art

Imagine you’re studying classical painters. Would it be better to focus on each artist one at a time or study multiple artists simultaneously?

It turns out that learning about them together makes you better at identifying each artist’s work. That’s because comparing and contrasting their styles helps your brain pick up on subtle differences and similarities, leading to a better overall understanding.

You start recognizing patterns across subjects, which strengthens your knowledge in ways that focusing on just one doesn’t.

## Applying Interleaving to Coding

I’m hoping that by applying interleaving to my coding practice, I’m training my brain to handle the complexity of learning multiple concepts at once.

Beyond just React and TypeScript, I want to improve my cognitive flexibility, making it easier to learn new technologies down the road. (Rust is definitely on my radar.)

That said, it's not exactly a smooth process.

Looking at code that needs debugging and not knowing whether the issue lies with React, TypeScript, or both? Yeah, that’s an uncomfortable spot to be in.

But solving those problems and gaining a deeper understanding of what went wrong, why, and how to fix it? That’s something I can get used to—and I plan to.
