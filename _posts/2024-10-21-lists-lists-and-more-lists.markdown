The internet, I've come to realize, is just a bunch of lists. Every webpage is just a collection of one thing or another put into some sort of cohesive order on the page for our viewing pleasure.

Trying to decide what to watch? Yeah, Netflix is just a big list of TV shows and movies. Then you head to IMDB for a list of actors and an associated list of stuff they've been in.

Social media? That's just a bunch of lists too. Instagram is a list of pictures with lists of comments. Facebook is a list of stuff bots wrote to trick old people. X (the artist formerly known as Twitter) is just a list of short text posts.

Yes, lists are everywhere.

So getting really good at recognizing lists, iterating through them, and displaying them to the page is a key skill for software engineers.

And that's what I'm focused on today.

I'm currently working on an app that takes a list of notes and puts them all on the page. I want to make each note look nice, so I'm "thinking in React" and making some reusable components.

This type of programming is nice. It makes sense to me. I like it.
