It's honestly a strange time to be coding. AI is capable of writing a lot of code, and it's only going to get better at it over time.

If you don't think about it too much, you might think that this means the end of software engineers -- their skills will be obsolete and AI will be able to do the same things but faster and with cleaner code.

So why bother learning to code? You could spend your time going all in on learning to get AI to write code for you. And maybe that's the smarter option.

## Why I'm learning

Despite the fact that AI is only getting better, it's still just a tool that can improve your human capabilities. And the better your capabilities are, the more likely AI will be able to help you now and in the future.

Here are some reasons I think that learning to code still makes sense, even with the constant and insanely fast improvement of AI tools:

1. Understanding fundamentals will help you communicate to the AI. You'll be able to clearly articulate what you want and guide the AI toward your vision better than someone without a foundational understanding of how code works.

2. AI is just a tool. The "what" to build, the "why" to build it, and the many iterative challenges that come with finding a product-market fit are still very much human-problems. When you understand both the code and the purpose of the code you become a better creator and end up with better outcomes.

3. The future of AI is promising, but the timeline is uncertain. It feels like AI is progressing at a ridiculously fast rate, so it's easy for us to think that progress will continue forever. The truth is, nobody knows the limits of AI -- we could be very close to the best that AI will ever get.

In the present, it makes sense to learn how to code and how to use AI. Both skills are valuable, and for now they're both necessary to be a good software engineer.

Maybe in the next 100 years AI will make software engineering completely obsolete. Heck, maybe it will happen tomorrow.

Somehow I doubt it.
