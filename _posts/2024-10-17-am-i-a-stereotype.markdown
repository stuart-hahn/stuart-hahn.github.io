# Am I a Stereotype?

Admittedly, I have some strange interests. I love to dive into configuration docs, for instance, and I use a Moonlander keyboard and the Colemak keyboard layout, and I'm a beekeeper, and recently I've been trying my hand at sewing.

Of course, we all contain multitudes -- but I guess in my hubris I thought my interests were unique... but ChatGPT set me straight. I was working on configuring Arch Linux (btw) and got curious about what other hobbies AI would recommend I try.

So I asked.

And boy oh boy, it turns out I might be a stereotype, because ChatGPT hit the nail on the head with its suggestions.

- Minimalism? Check.
- Quantified self? Check.
- Mechanical keyboards? Check.
- Tiling window managers? Check.
- Automation and scripting? Check.
- Vim/Neovim development? Check.
- Personal knowledge management? Check.

My interest in every single one of these things made me feel like a weirdo on its own -- and combined altogether I thought there's no way other people have this same pool of curiosities.

But dude, ChatGPT got all of this ON THE FIRST TRY. I didn't even have to give much context or make an advanced prompt. I was just like, "Hey, I'm really having fun setting up Neovim, what other hobbies do you think I'd like?"

Technology is nuts -- and the crazy thing is that today it is "The worst it will ever be." Just chew on that for a minute.
