I'm learning the foundational concepts of TypeScript because I want to use TypeScript in all of my projects moving forward. It's a modern approach to coding, and I'm personally drawn to the structure that it provides. That's also why I'm interested in learning Rust next. Immutable by default? Sign me up.

## The super basics

JavaScript is great because it lets you do whatever you want, but it's greatest strength is also one of its greatest weaknesses. TypeScript adds "types", which you can use to build guardrails into your application to make sure that the data you're passing around is what you want it to be.

There are some common, basic types:

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- any

```TypeScript
// string
let firstName: string = "Stuart"

// number
let age: number = 36

// boolean
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true
```

So, the syntax for basic types is simple. When you're declaring the variable, you simply also declare the type that the data in the variable should be.

From then on, TypeScript will do the hard work of ensuring that only appropriate data is assigned, reducing runtime errors and improving code clarity. It's more work up front, but less work deciphering bugs that could have been easily prevented.
