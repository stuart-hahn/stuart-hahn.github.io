"Tutorial Hell" is this frustrating zone between *learning to code* and *actually building stuff*. I'm currently trying to escape Tutorial Hell by building stuff on my own without the training wheels of tutorials.

It's really hard at first. Every little mole-hill turns into a mountain, and it feels so slow because you're used to moving at supersonic speed.

A tutorial will have you build a full-stack application in 8 hours, so you start to think that 8 hours is a reasonable amount of time for that sort of project.

But it's not.

Those 8 hours are how long it takes to *copy the code* that someone else ALREADY wrote -- they already did the hard part.

Now it's your turn to do the hard part. So sit down and code, and stop thinking about how slow you're moving and how lost you are.

Pick a little thing -- make progress. Rinse and repeat.
