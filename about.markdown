# About Me

Hey, I’m Stuart.

Right now, I’m Head of Operations at Speak_, a startup that’s using AI to help recruiters find the best candidate. When I’m not working, I’m probably hacking away at some code.

This site’s basically just a place for me to log what I’m working on and toss around some future ideas.

## What I’m Into

- AI
- Linux
- Neovim
- Beekeeping
- Rocket League

## Random Facts

I used to be a professional gamer. Got ranked #3 worldwide in Madden and ran a subscription site selling tips to players trying to up their game. That whole thing led to me becoming a full-time Twitch streamer, pulling in 300-500 viewers every night, streaming for over 300 straight days.

Eventually, my site got acquired by a bigger gaming company, and I ended up wearing all sorts of hats—community manager, podcast host, tournament organizer—you name it. My podcast hit almost 10,000 downloads every week, where I interviewed top Madden players, streamers, and devs.

## What’s Next?

I’m always following my interests, so honestly, no idea what’s around the corner. Right now, I’m ricing my Arch Linux setup while trying to master full-stack app dev.

I’m also really interested in AI, especially how today’s decisions might impact the future—longtermism fascinates me. If I can, I’d love to help tackle some of the world’s biggest problems like factory farming, climate change, or avoiding AI disasters.

You know, the light stuff.
